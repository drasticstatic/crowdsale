## Overview
This component handles the token purchase functionality in the crowdsale application. It provides a user interface for buying tokens with ETH (Ethereum) and manages the transaction process.

## Key Features
- Form for entering the amount of tokens to buy
- Button to submit the purchase transaction
- Loading spinner during transaction processing
- Error handling for failed transactions

## Props
The Buy component receives these values from its parent component:
- `provider`: Connection to the Ethereum blockchain
- `price`: Current price of one token in ETH
- `crowdsale`: Reference to the crowdsale smart contract
- `setIsLoading`: Function to update loading state in parent component

## State Variables
- `amount`: How many tokens the user wants to buy
- `isWaiting`: Whether the component is waiting for transaction confirmation

## Main Function: buyHandler
This function handles the token purchase process:
1. Prevents default form submission behavior
2. Shows a loading spinner
3. Gets the user's wallet (signer) from the provider
4. Calculates how much ETH is needed based on token amount and price
5. Formats the token amount for the blockchain (with 18 decimal places)
6. Sends the transaction to the crowdsale contract
7. Waits for transaction confirmation
8. Handles errors (user rejection or transaction failure)
9. Updates the parent component's loading state

## UI Components
- Form: Container for the input and button
- Form.Control: Input field for token amount
- Button: "Buy Tokens" button that submits the form
- Spinner: Loading indicator shown during transaction processing

## Technical Notes
- The `signer` object represents the user's wallet and is needed to authorize the transaction
- `ethers.utils.parseUnits` converts regular numbers to the format the blockchain uses (with 18 decimal places)
- The `value` parameter in the transaction is the amount of ETH being sent
- When a transaction is submitted, the user's wallet (like MetaMask) will prompt for confirmation

## Error Handling
The component uses a try/catch block to handle transaction errors:
- If the user rejects the transaction in their wallet
- If the transaction fails (e.g., due to insufficient funds)
- In either case, an alert is shown to the user

## Data Flow
1. User enters token amount in the input field
2. User clicks "Buy Tokens" button
3. Component sends transaction to blockchain
4. After transaction completes or fails, parent component is notified to refresh data
